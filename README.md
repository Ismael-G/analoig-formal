## Analog Formal Verification

Verification of IC designs is a very important feild. Traditional methods involve probing Spice files with a set of voltages or using Verilog-A to run DUT(Design Under Test) testbenches. Traditional methods struugle with not being covering enough tests and their high simulation times. Formal Verification attempts to solve this issue.
